This project is a web platform designed to promote eco-tourism and cultural tourism in Jharkhand. It highlights popular tourist destinations, local culture, handicrafts, and sustainable travel options in a visually appealing and user-friendly way. Users can explore top attractions such as waterfalls, temples, wildlife sanctuaries, and cultural sites while learning about local traditions, festivals, and crafts. The website features a responsive design for easy navigation on all devices and includes image galleries with interactive effects.
The platform is built using HTML, CSS, and Tailwind CSS, with future enhancements planned using JavaScript and React.js for dynamic pages and AI-based personalized travel suggestions. Future updates aim to include AI-generated itineraries, integration of a booking system for local guides and eco-stays, a mobile app version, and a user rating and feedback system.
Contributions are welcome, and developers can fork the repository and submit pull requests to help improve and expand the platform. This project is open-source and available under the MIT License.
